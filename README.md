🌱 Digital GreenWall – Gamified Eco-Interaction Companion App
📌 Project Overview

Digital GreenWall is a mobile app prototype designed to help school and college students reconnect with nature using fun digital experiences. The app uses gamification, eco-challenges, avatars, team missions, and rewards to encourage daily eco-friendly actions. The goal of this project is to make environmental care easy, enjoyable, and habit-forming.

🎯 Problem Statement

Many students spend most of their time on screens and have little interaction with nature. Because of this, they feel less connected to the environment and are less motivated to take eco-friendly actions. Digital GreenWall aims to solve this problem by turning real-world green actions into fun challenges with rewards.
